## - CHANGELOG -

### Here I write about changes and different versions of the project.

## Version 0.0.1 (Major Beta Release)

As at writing today 25th July, 2019 I am still working on the gameplay, I encountered an issue with how to
implement gamestops (yellow / red cards): when there's a foul. So for now, I will leave that and continue development reason being I
_need_ to finish this by this weekend :)

Thank you Jesus!
